Commercial License:
This is the appropriate option if you are creating proprietary applications
and you are not prepared to distribute and share the source code of your
application under the GPL.
If you wish to derive a commercial advantage by not releasing your application
under an open source license, you must purchase an appropriate number of
commercial licenses from CAMDA. By purchasing commercial licenses,
you are no longer obligated to publish your source code.

Open Source License:
CAMDA is an avid supporter of open source software. This is the
appropriate option if you are creating an open source application with
a license compatible with the GNU GPL license v2.
